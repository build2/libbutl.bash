  # Note that bash co-process facility is racy: as soon as the process
  # finishes, bash unsets COPROC/COPROC_PID (my guess would be it checks after
  # each command in the script). This specific sequence of steps (and the one
  # in *_finish()) seems to work reliably at least from bash 4.3.30 and
  # up. See the following resources for details:
  #
  # http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/keywords/coproc
  # http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/bashver4.html (coproc section)
  # https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2014-02/msg00017.html
  # https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2012-12/msg00069.html

  #
  # Also note that the bash bug (still present in 5.0) prevents running
  # multiple coprocesses at a time (see the BUGS section of bash(1) man page
  # for details).
  #
  # An update: it turns out that we still can end up with an unset COPROC if
  # the process finishes too early. To avoid that we suspend the subshell
  # before executing the parser process and resume it after querying the
  # COPROC value. Note that we need to be careful not to attempt to resume the
  # process that hasn't suspended itself (see butl_resume_process() for
  # details).
  #
  # Note that the suspend builtin doesn't work in subshells by default since
  # there is no job control enabled for them. Also when it is enabled (via
  # `set -m`), the builtin stops subshells recursively up to the command being
  # run from the interactive shell, which is not what we want. That's why we
  # use kill which is also a builtin and thus presumably is not slower than
  # suspend.
